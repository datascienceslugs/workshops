# Data Science Slugs Workshops
*Anders Poirel*

This (WIP) repository hosts all the deliverables for Data Science Slugs @ UCSC's workshops and activities - or at least those were a member who bothered to use version control was in charge.

## Structure

`w2020` contains all the materials for the Winter Quarter of 2020 as UC Santa Cruz, and so on.

## Contributing

Non-text files (`.pdfs`, `.png`, `.ipynb`) should be tracked exclusively with 
[Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/). This is necessary to 
avoid unmanageable repository sizes as we add several quarter's worth of files

## Use

You are free to re-use any material here for any purpose, but crediting us in your presentations/projects is always appreciated ðŸ˜ƒ
